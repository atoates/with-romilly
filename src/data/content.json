      "description": "Reflexology is a well-established, non-invasive complementary therapy which is recognised by the NHS and many hospices. It is a deeply relaxing and stress relieving therapy which can help a wide-range of mental and physical conditions as well as aiding detoxification. It is well known to calm the nervous system and boost the immune system. The body's organs, glands and systems are mapped on our feet, hands and face, and by stimulating these reflex points with reflexology it un-blocks any stagnation, restores balance and promotes the body's own healing processes. Reflexology encourages the body to return to a state of homeostasis and brings it back to optimum health. Each treatment promotes the release of endorphins in the body (feel good hormones), improves circulation and boosts mood and wellbeing.",

      "description": "One of the major ways that Reflexology helps couples to conceive is by reducing stress and balancing hormones because stress and hormonal imbalances can have a major impact on a couple's chance of conceiving. Pre-conceptual Reflexology helps to create the perfect body ecology for a viable and healthy pregnancy. By stimulating certain reflex points, we help balance the endocrine system (responsible for hormonal health). Reflexology gives your body a re-boot - kick-starting the reproductive system, regulating hormonal functions and aiding detoxification so that you are in the best stead for a successful conception. Throughout your pregnancy, reflexology helps reduce aches and pains and brings balance to your mind and body. Reflexology can be helpful post-partum to re-energise, re-balance and aid healing.",
